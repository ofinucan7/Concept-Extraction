DISTRIBUTIONS1VARIABLES
• Variable: a characteristic that is measured or observed on a
subject that differs from case to case
Level of
Measurement
Definition Examples
Quantitative Values result from counting or measuring Price of house, square footage
Categorical Values often result from observing subjects and
classifying them into groups
External material, has a garage
Descriptive
Orientation
Definition Examples
Response
(Dependent)
Variable that is being investigated and want to
predict; being described by other variables
Price of house
Predictor
(Independent)
Variable that is used (often in conjunction with other
variables) to describe a response variable
Square footage, number of rooms,
external material, has a garage2EXAMPLE:VARIABLES

by its maximum height, track length, and material (steel or wood).

descriptive orientation?

STATISTICAL TERMINOLOGY
• Population: any complete collection of items or measurements that
a statistician/researcher is interested in studying
• Parameter: a value that describes a characteristic of a population
• Generally unknown – need access to every member of the population
• Examples: 𝜇 (mean), 𝜎 (standard deviation), 𝑝 (proportion)
• Sample: a subset of items selected from the population to more
easily study and better understand the population
• Representative of the population on a smaller scale
• Statistic: a value calculated from a sample that serves as an
estimate of a parameter
• Examples: ത𝑋 (mean), 𝑆 (standard deviation), Ƹ 𝑝 (proportion)4EXAMPLE: STATISTICAL TERMINOLOGY
• Scenario: Want to understand the average top speed of a roller
coaster. Random sample of 30 coasters found a sample mean of
54.33 mph.
• Task: Identify the population, parameter, sample, and statistic.

• Population: ____________________
• Parameter: _________________ of ____ roller coasters
• Exact value is _________, but we can represent it __________________
• Sample: ___________________________
• Statistic: ____________5NUMERIC SUMMARIES OF QUANTITATIVE DATA
• Mean: the average of a set of data
ത𝑋 = 1
𝑛 ෍𝑖=1
𝑛
𝑋𝑖 = 𝑋1 + 𝑋2 + ⋯ + 𝑋𝑛
𝑛
• Standard deviation: measure of how far away an observation is
from the mean
𝑆 = σ𝑖=1
𝑛 𝑋𝑖 − ത𝑋 2
𝑛 − 1
• Percentile: value at or below which a given percentage of a
variable’s values fall
Distance from Mean Description
Within 1 SD Common and not unusual
Between 1 and 2 SD Slightly unusual
Between 2 and 3 SD Unusual but not unheard of
More than 3 SD Quite uncommon (Outliers)6
GRAPHICAL SUMMARIES OF QUANTITATIVE DATA
• Histogram: displays distribution of quantitative data using bars of
different heights to show frequencies in each range
• Defined by symmetry/skewness and modality
• Symmetry: Symmetric, left-skewed (longer left tail), right-skewed (longer right tail)
• Modality: Unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
• Boxplot: divides quantitative data into quartiles where:
• Box represents the middle 50% of the data
• Whiskers represents top and bottom 25% respectively
• Outliers (extreme observations) are denoted with individual points
1st quartile
25th percentile
Median
50th percentile
3rd quartile
75th percentileOutliers7EXAMPLE: ANALYZING DATA SUMMARIES
• Scenario: Track length of 30 roller coasters plotted in histogram
along with the sample mean and standard deviation

• Answer:
• Histogram: Track length is ________ and _________ with
a mean ______________
• One peak at _____ feet with a ____________ of observations
on each side
• Mean: Average length of the 30 coasters is __________
• Standard Deviation: Coaster lengths tend to ________
___________ feet by about ________________________
• Coaster lengths between ______ and ______ feet are ______
________ as they lie within ___ standard deviation of the mean

• Scenario: Top speed of the same 30 roller coasters plotted in the
boxplot along with the five-number summary.

• Answer:
• Boxplot: Top speed is _______________ with a median around ____
• Left whisker is ______________, indicating a few _____________________
• Median: ____ of the coasters in the sample had a top speed ___________
• Quartiles: ____ of the coasters had a top speed ____________ mph while
another ____ had a top speed ____________ mph9
PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
• Probability distribution: a function that describes the probability of
an event occurring given a value from the distribution
• Continuous distributions are defined as curves
• Area under the curve equals 1, so areas are interpreted as probabilities
• Change shape depending on the mean, standard deviation, degrees of
freedom, etc.
Normal Distribution Observations
• Blue curve is tallest because it has the smallest spread
• Red curve is shortest because it has the largest spread
• Grey curve is shifted farthest to the right because it
has the largest mean10STANDARD NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
• Standard normal distribution: probability distribution whose data is
described by a bell-shaped curve (unimodal and symmetric) with a
mean 𝜇 = 0 and population standard deviation 𝜎 = 1
• Values are referred to as Z-scores or Z-statistics
• Describes how many standard deviations an observation is from the
mean in data that is normal
• Values from any normal distribution can
be standardized using the equation

We’ll see how to do this calculation

• Degrees of freedom: a measure of how much information is
contained in a sample that is available to estimate parameters
• Occur in the t-distribution, F-distribution, and chi-squared distribution
• Range from 1 to ∞ and cause the distribution to change shapes
• Used to calculate p-values and critical values in inference
• Degrees of freedom are often dependent upon the sample size:
• Larger sample → More __________ → More ___ → More ______________
• Preview: In some cases, we can test multiple parameters at once
• This increases degrees of freedom in a different way, making it harder to
obtain powerful results
• More on this in a few weeks14T-DISTRIBUTION
• t-Distribution: continuous probability distribution that is similar to
the standard normal distribution in that it is symmetric, unimodal,
and centered at 0 but differs in that it:
• Is a family of distributions whose shape changes depending on the
degrees of freedom
• Has fatter tails and less area in the center
• As degrees of freedom increase,
the t-distribution gets taller in the
center with less area in the tails.15
F-DISTRIBUTION
• F-Distribution: continuous probability distribution used to compare
two sources of variability that has the following properties:
• Unimodal, right-skewed, and always non-negative
• Two parameters for degrees of freedom that determine the shape
• As the degrees of freedom increase, the F-distribution becomes less right-skewed
and more closely resembles a normal distribution
