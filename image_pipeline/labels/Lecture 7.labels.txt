Slide 1: None
Slide 2: Functions are used in programming
Slide 3: We use functions in programming similar to how functions are used in mathematics
Slide 4: A parameter is a variable or input that a function takes. 
	 The function body is the main chunk of the code.
	 The result that a function gives out can be returned.
	 We can take in zero or more parameters.
Slide 5: We are able to call functions that we make.
Slide 6: The visibility type determines who can call each function.
	 Static is a required element for now.
	 The function name is how you call a function.
	 The header is the first line of a function, which contains its name, its return type and parameters it takes in.
	The function body is the part of a function following the header that does the action of the function.
	 We can return a value from a function.
Slide 7: None
Slide 8: None
Slide 9: The return value should be what we want to give out of the function.
Slide 10: We should name our functions things that are relevant to what the function does.
Slide 11: The parameters are what we take into a function.
Slide 12: None
Slide 13: None
Slide 14: None
Slide 15: None
Slide 16: None
Slide 17: None
Slide 18: Scope is the relevance and level of access a function should have.
Slide 19: There are varying levels of scope.
Slide 20: None
Slide 21: The act of giving parameters to a function is called passing-in.
	  Java has 2 different types of passing-in.
Slide 22: Pass-by-value is sending a copy of a variable to a function.
	  If we pass-by-value a variable, changes made will not reflect when the function returns.
	  All primitive variable types are pass-by-value.
Slide 23: Pass-by-reference is giving the function full access to the variable.
	  A pass-by-reference variable is updated by the function.
	  All non-primitive type variables are pass-by-reference.
Slide 24: None
Slide 25: We can make a public static function.
	  When making a function, we need to set all of these components.
Slide 26: We should use void as our return type because we don't need to give back any information.
Slide 27: None
